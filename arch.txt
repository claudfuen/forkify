Model-View-Controller
Architecture Pattern

Real Modules, is a better separation of concerns...



Model (data and apps logic)
    Search.js
    Recipe

Controller
    Index.js

View (Get data from and to UI)
    SearchView.js

Why do we do it this way, because it increases the flexibility of the code
