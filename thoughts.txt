After installing the app from the Shopify App store, the app is redirecting to the website where the app is hosted.
When accessing the app from a shop's app dashboard the app is redirecting to the embedded version. 
This occurs when an initial OAuth request redirect fails to escape the iframe. 
Please refer to our embedded app OAuth documentation for further information.  


Your app is not using the Billing API. 
We are no longer accepting apps who are not using it and moving all existing apps over as well. 
All fees associated with your service need to be handled by 
Shopify using the Billing API.

============================================================================================
Shopify Billing API:
https://help.shopify.com/en/api/app-store/charging-for-your-app/guides/implement-billing-model
============================================================================================
Do this right on account creation......... It will automatically manage the trial period and charges accordingly.

1- First, create a recurring charge ---- Need 4 things for this:\
POST /admin/recurring_application_charges.json
We need to track if the user is reinstalling the app and then prorate their free trial. We can calculate this by looking into their cancellation day
And this can ebe done by subscribing to the cancellation web hook

{
  "recurring_application_charge": {
    "name": "Super Duper Plan",
    "price": 10.0,
    "return_url": "http://super-duper.shopifyapps.com",
    "trial_days": 7
  }
}


2- Second, redirect the merchant to the Confirmation URL returned by shopify.

{
    "application_charge": {
        "id": 44433414,
        "name": "App charge",
        "api_client_id": 1968176,
        "price": "100.00",
        "status": "pending",
        "return_url": "http://super-duper.shopifyapps.com/",
        "test": true,
        "created_at": "2018-02-09T14:04:54-05:00",
        "updated_at": "2018-02-09T14:04:54-05:00",
        "charge_type": null,
        "decorated_return_url": "http://super-duper.shopifyapps.com/?charge_id=44433414",
        "confirmation_url": "https://domain.myshopify.com/admin/charges/44433414/confirm_application_charge?signature=BAhpBAYApgI%3D--b7661dbc3eac11eaeb71b1d0e9b9bcb4b9a531ba"
    }
}

3- Third, get the Charge ID from the reposnse, and activate the charge by sending a post request to: 
/admin/recurring_application_charges/{charge_id}/activate.json



============================================================================================
Shopify OAuth Break:
https://help.shopify.com/en/api/embedded-apps/embedded-app-sdk/getting-started#oauth
https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started/authentication/oauth#step-2-ask-for-permission
============================================================================================

We need to use the METHOD on the Shopify Embedded App SDK so that it escapes the iFrame, istead of redirecting from our self-hosted url. The OAuth has to occur on a parent level redirect window, not the frame, and this is easily achieved with the SDK
